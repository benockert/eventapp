*This repository, mainly ```lib/eventapp_web/templates``` includes code from and based on Nat Tuck's
in-class PhotoBlog example.*

# HW7 Design
- Anyone can view an event, logged-in or not
- Only a registered and logged-in user can create/edit events and view users
- A user can only edit their own information
- The datepicker is confined to only dates in the future.
