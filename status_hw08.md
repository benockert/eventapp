Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Ben Ockert



2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/benockert/eventapp


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
events.benockert.site


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
The only thing not working 100% is the . I generate a URL when an event is updated, but when a user accesses that path, it only works if they already exist as a user. If they don't, it takes them to the "Update user" page to complete their profile before accessing the event. I tried many ways to use the "referer" header in the 'conn' to direct back to the .../events/# page after a new user completes their account, but I couldn't get the referer path I needed to staty around long enough.

5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Deployed
